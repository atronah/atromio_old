atromio is an abbreviation of "ATROnah's Money is In Order".
It is program for accounting of budget: receipts and expenditure, borrowing, expired dates of goods, billings, price developments, exchange rates.
Idea came about 2013.
Design started in around the beginning of 2015.
Implementation started in May 2015.
In parallel with development I plan to study\explore\try new (for me) technologies: git + github, PostgreSQL, QML, deploy tools, image processing (for scan barcodes by webcam and recognitions order items) and may be something else (I hope).
